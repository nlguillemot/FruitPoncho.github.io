				&emsp; This Game is still a <font color="#FF0000">BETA</font>! This means the gameplay is all there but we're still working on final polish and menus. There will be updates and getting it now gives you full access to all future updates including the final version.

				<b>One Bullet:</b><br>
				That's right one bullet. Only one dang bullet. Don't even think about worrying about only having about one bullet though because...
				<br><br>
				<b>Screen-wrap Action™:</b><br>
				You'll never lose your precious missile because just when it leaves the screen, it comes popping right back in the other direction! Catch your bullet again in order to fire at your foes once more. (catching is like being shot but it's your own bullet so it's OK!)
				Screen-wrap Action isn't actually trademarked :(
				<br><br>
				<b>One Life: </b><br>
				Get hit by one stray shot and you're out for the round! I'm afraid it's pretty straight-forward, I don't have much babbling to do about this one. You get hit; it's over!
				<br><br>
				<b>Endless Fun:</b><br>
				Oh jeez this one was a buzzword and a half. I've sold out already. I'm so sorry.
